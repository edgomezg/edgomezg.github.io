  Originally from Logro√±o and now based in Madrid, I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Telecommunications Engineering from the Public University of Navarre (UPNA) in Pamplona. Currently, I am pursuing a Double Master's Degree in Telecommunications Engineering and Advanced Communications Technologies at Carlos III University of Madrid, with an expected completion date of June 2025.

  I am profoundly passionate about technology, with a particular interest in wireless communications, radio-frequency technologies, signal processing, and machine learning. I thrive in team environments and enjoy collaborating with colleagues across diverse settings, maintaining a proactive attitude focused on enhancing both my skills and those of others. I am eager to continue learning and contributing to projects that drive innovation and collective growth.

  Here, you can find a selection of my [projects](https://edgomezg.github.io/projects/) showcasing my main skills, along with my [CV](https://edgomezg.github.io/cv/). Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or comments through any of the contact options below.
