I did my bachelor thesis during an Erasmus stay in University of Genoa (Italy), where I was enrolled in Internet and Multimedia Engineering Master's Degree as the equivalent to the fourth year of the Bachelor's Degree in Telecommunications Engineering in Public University of Navarre. Here you can find a summary of the work carried out as well as the link to the complete text.

## Abstract 

The use of GPR imaging techniques is of great interest in certain fields such as
archaeology, civil engineering or geology. However, in order to obtain results, an inverse
problem needs to be solved. When working with experimental data, it is necessary to adopt
calibration techniques due to the spurious effects that appear. For this reason, two antenna
calibration methods have been implemented and evaluated in this thesis with several test
and calibration targets, obtaining results that will be beneficial for current and to continue
with future research in this field. The activities related to this thesis have been carried out
at the Applied Electromagnetics Laboratory of the Department of Electrical, Electronic,
Telecommunication Engineering, and Naval Architecture (DITEN) of the University of
Genoa.
