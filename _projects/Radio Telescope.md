This project is the result of a 6-month work Internship in the Public University of Navarre in 2022. Here you can find a summary of the work carried out as well as the link to the complete text.

## Abstract 

This project focuses on enhancing the capabilities of the Jocellyn Bell Burnell Radio Telescope at the Public University of Navarre. Key improvements include the development of a calibration and observation system and partial automation of the telescopeâ€™s movement system. The calibration system enables accurate detection of the 21-cm hydrogen line, crucial for observing neutral hydrogen in galactic structures, using software-defined radio (SDR) receivers, specifically RSPduo and BladeRF devices. Custom modifications to GNU Radio software allow for the saving and re-utilization of calibration settings, streamlining future observations. The automation of the telescope's movement system was achieved via a client-server setup, allowing it to follow preset paths without manual intervention. This project not only enhances the telescope's operational precision but also promotes radio astronomy among university students, offering a practical platform for academic research and skill development in telecommunications and astrophysics.
